### Description

This code is a VB6 Add-on that, when compiled as a Dll into your VB directory will place itself in the Add-ons menu. When run, it will open up a window showing you all the variables you have declared but have not used anywhere. why would you want to know this? I work for a company writing a VB app that is 600,000 lines long right now. you can save yourself about 8 megs of memory consumption this way.
